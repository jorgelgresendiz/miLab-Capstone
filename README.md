# miLab



miLab is a mobile friendly app aimed to help the cumbersome management of inventory in lab. All lab members are encouraged to implement this in their day-to-day lab activities. As a user of this app you can expect to:

- Make an account for the lab where all your items in inventory will be displayed
- View all items in your lab inventory as separate cards
- View the name, current quantity, date of arrival or the item any comments that the receiver might leave for the lab.
- Add a new item as a card with the accompanying details shown above.
- Delete a card completely.
- Update the quantity of items received by the press of a + or - button
- View a single card
- View the image of the item on the card
- Update the name, date of arrival, or comments left on an item. 


## Introduction

Keeping track of every day lab items is a hassle. In my experience, going to the inventory room and keeping track of lab items on paper or an Excel spreadsheet is unrealiable and impractical. miLab is a way around all of this. Scrolling through your phone and wondering whether you'll have enough RPMI for TC this week? Stay on your phone and check the inventory immediately. Happy researching!
